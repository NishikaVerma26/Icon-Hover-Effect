# Icon-Hover-Effect
An icon hover effect is a visual enhancement that can be added to icons on a website or application using HTML and CSS. This effect is triggered when a user hovers their mouse pointer over an icon and can help to provide visual feedback and improve the overall user experience.
To create an icon hover effect, a designer can start by selecting an icon and creating a container element for it in HTML. The designer can then use CSS to add styles to the container element that will be applied when the icon is hovered over. This can include changes to the background color, text color, or the addition of a subtle animation effect.

Some common techniques for creating icon hover effects using CSS include using the :hover pseudo-class to apply styles when an icon is hovered over, using CSS transitions or animations to create smooth visual effects, and using CSS gradients or shadows to create depth and dimension.

Overall, an icon hover effect can be a simple but effective way to add visual interest and interactivity to icons on a website or application, making it easier for users to interact with and understand the content.
